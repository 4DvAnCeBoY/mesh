## Tagging

There is only one root tag per project. The root tag is linked to various other tags which can be of different types. Tags can have i18n properties.

A tag must have a specify schema. Schemas can be created using the schemas verticle. The schema defines the type and name of each property.

## Groups

Groups are used to organize users. Roles can be assigned to groups. A user in a group with roles inherits those roles and the linked permissions to those roles.
