## Versioning Feature

This version of Gentics Mesh introduces versioning of contents. A detailed description of the versioning feature can be found in our [Documentation](http://getmesh.io/docs/beta/index.html).

Important changes summary:

* Node update request must now include the version information
* The query parameter `?version=draft` must be used to load newly created draft nodes. Otherwise the node will not be found because the default version scope is __published__.
* Two additional permissions for nodes have been added: __publish__, __readpublished__

Existing databases will automatically be migrated during the first startup.
